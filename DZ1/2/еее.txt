The largest organisms on Earth
What is the largest organism living on Earth?
 How about those that are extinct1 now? These questions are trickier2 than
 they look. Are they about height, mass, volume or maybe length? 
Sometimes we can see only a small part of an otherwise huge living creature. 
Other times you can argue3 that a colony of organisms that behaves4 as one creature 
also needs to be considered5. Let’s at least try to find out what are the largest
 creatures in some taxonomic kingdoms6 out there.

We’ll start with the animal kingdom. Of all the living animals the largest one 
(and also the heaviest one) is the majestic7 blue whale. It’s so large that there
 are no scales8 available to weigh them as a whole. The heaviest blue whale ever
 recorded was at 190 tonnes, while the longest was about 33 meters long. It still
 came shorter than a humble lion’s mane jellyfish that is nearly 37 meters long.
